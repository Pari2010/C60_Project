    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies: <br>Making bracelets, sewing, and art!</h1>
    
    
    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <h3> My favorite hobbies are sewing and making bracelets! I like sewing because I saw my mom sew. I was really confident and decided to try sewing, and then, I fell INLOVE with it! I also love making bracelets because my sister had a bracelet making kit! I was making a bracelet and an earing for myself. Then, I begged my parents to buy me a bracelet kit, and they said yes! So when the package came, I instantly opened it and started making my bracelet right away. As days went by, we had a family occasion and all of my cousins were there! We all had a sleepover at my house! So then, I started a business of making bracelets for my family. Everything went well! My next favorite hobby, is art! My all time favorite hobby since I was a little kid! I had a  princess coloring book, so I would tear out the pages from the coloring book and start coloring right away! Then a few years later, other people were also amazed by my drawing skills! That's when I developed the love of art! I love these hobbies!</h3>
